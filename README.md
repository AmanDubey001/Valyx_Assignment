Problem statement: 

Design a multi-select dropdown menu to categorize items hierarchically. Each dropdown element should have three possible states:

Selected: Indicates that the entire category is chosen.
Unselected: Indicates that the entire category is not chosen.
Partially Selected: Indicates that some items within the category are chosen, while others are not.

This setup allows users to efficiently navigate and select categories based on their preferences while maintaining clarity about the selection status at both the category and item levels.
